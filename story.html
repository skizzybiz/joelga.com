        <p><span class="intro">Once upon a time</span> there were two silly 
        people – one boy from Maryland by way of Pittsburgh and San Francisco, 
        and one girl from Ukraine by way of London and Cupertino and all number
        of places. By fate (or whoever controls these things), they met one day.</p>
        
        <p>
          <span class="offset" style="left: 180px">They were both a little unsure </span>
          <br>
          <span class="offset" style="left: 180px">and a little insecure, </span>
          <br>
          <span class="offset" style="left: 100px">but amazingly, they were just </span>
          <br>
          <span class="offset" style="left: 100px">perfect for each other, </span>
          <br>
          and they began a family, in 
          <br>
          San Francisco by the sea.</p>
      
        <p>The family grew
          <br>
          little by little, 
          <br>
          in the way that 
          <br>
          families do.</p>

        <p>First came a little ball of fluff who loved pancakes and ham. The
        ways of cats are inscrutable, but to the silly people who loved her, it
        seemed that she was never afraid to speak her mind or sing the virtues of
        her shiny coat. Above all, though, she loved to curl up and share her
        warmth.</p>

      <section id="sam" class="page">
        <p>Next came an even more curious subject. With a crooked tail and more
        than his share of toes, he seemed at first implacable. Then the calm 
        turned to fear – of what, they could never know – but eventually, they
        convinced him that there was nothing to be afraid of, except perhaps the
        occasional stray breeze. In time, he discovered an unwavering love for
        a tiny mouse on a wire, which, though a short-lived creature, has borne
        a proud bloodline.</p>

        <p>The family grew weary of their neighborhood, with its never-ending
        hustle and bustle and its concrete alleys and misty days. They packed
        up all their odds and ends and trekked across the bay, into Oakland, to
        live in a quiet cottage. They swept out the cobwebs, painted the walls,
        planted some plants, and hung up their knick knacks. With the sun 
        shining in every morning on their tree-lined street, they were
        satisfied that they had found a home where they could grow.</p>

        <p>These two people loved their family, and they loved the conversations
        that they had with the furry ones every day – but still, they longed
        for a little person, one who could see the world fresh and show them
        things they'd never seen. They wished, and they wished, and...</p>
